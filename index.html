    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>City University's origins lie in the calls for a "second polytechnic" in the years following the 1972 establishment of the Hong Kong Polytechnic. In 1982, Executive Council member Chung Sze-yuen spoke of a general consensus that "a second polytechnic of similar size to the first should be built as soon as possible."[3] District administrators from Tuen Mun and Tsuen Wan lobbied the government to build the new institution in their respective new towns.[3] The government instead purchased temporary premises at the new Argyle Centre Tower II in Mong Kok, a property developed by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in concert with the then-Argyle station. The new school was called City Polytechnic of Hong Kong, a name chosen among nearly 300 suggestions made by members of the public.[4]</p>

    <p>The new polytechnic opened on 8 October 1984, welcoming 480 full-time and 680 part-time students.[5] The provision for part-time students contributed to high enrolment, with the quota being filled almost immediately.[5]</p>
    
    <p>A tract of land on the former site of a village named Chu Koo Chai [yue] was chosen for the new campus.[6] The architectural contract to design the campus was won by Percy Thomas Partnership in association with Alan Fitch and W.N. Chung.[7] It was originally slated to open by October 1988.[8] The first phase was officially opened by Governor Wilson on 15 January 1990, and boasted 14 lecture theatres and 1,500 computers.[9] By 1991, the school had over 8,000 full-time students and approximately 3,000 part-time students.[10] The second phase of the permanent campus opened 1993.[7]</p>
    
    <blockquote>The school achieved university status in 1994 and the name was changed accordingly.[11]</blockquote>
